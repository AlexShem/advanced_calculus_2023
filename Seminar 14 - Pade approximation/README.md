# Padé Approximation Method: A Comprehensive Guide

## 1. Background and Introduction

- Brief history of the Padé approximation.
- Overview of the method and its importance in numerical analysis.
- Comparison with other approximation methods.

The Padé approximation, named after Henri Padé, is a method of approximating functions that has found significant utility in numerical analysis. Unlike polynomial approximations such as Taylor series, which only use the function's values and derivatives at a single point, Padé approximation represents a function as the ratio of two polynomials. This allows it to capture more complex behaviors, particularly near singularities or in functions with rapid oscillations.

### Why Padé Approximation?

The key advantage of Padé approximation lies in its ability to provide better approximations over a wider range of the function's domain, especially for functions where a Taylor series would diverge or fail to converge rapidly. For instance, in cases of functions with poles or essential singularities, Padé approximants often give a more accurate representation than a truncated Taylor series.

### Comparing with Other Methods

While Taylor series are straightforward and effective for smooth and well-behaved functions, they fall short in dealing with functions having poles or essential singularities within or near the interval of interest. In contrast, the Padé approximation can effectively approximate such functions, offering a more accurate and convergent series.

### The Mathematical Formulation

A function f(x) is approximated by the Padé approximant of order $[m, n]$ as:

$$R_{m,n}(x) = \frac{P_m(x)}{Q_n(x)}$$

where $P_m(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $m$ and $Q_n(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $n$. The coefficients of these polynomials are determined such that the Taylor series expansion of $R_{m,n}(x)$ matches as many terms as possible with the Taylor series of $f(x)$.

### Applications

Padé approximations are widely used in various fields of science and engineering. They are particularly useful in numerical solutions of differential equations, quantum mechanics, control theory, and signal processing. The ability to handle functions with singularities and rapid oscillations makes Padé approximation an invaluable tool in mathematical modeling and computational analysis.

In the following sections, we will explore practical examples of Padé approximation using MATLAB, starting with a simple sine function and then moving on to more complex functions that demonstrate the method's versatility.

## 2. Sine Function Example with [1 2] Padé Approximation

- Introduction to the sine function example.
- Mathematical formulation of the [1 2] Padé approximation for sine.
- Discussing the choice of approximation order.

To illustrate the basic concept of Padé approximation, let's start with a familiar and relatively simple function: the sine function. We will specifically look at the [1 2] Padé approximation of $\sin(x)$.

### Mathematical Formulation

The [1 2] Padé approximant of a function is represented as a ratio of two first-order polynomials:

$$R_{1, 2}(x) = \frac{a_0 + a_1x}{1 + b_1x + b_2x^2}$$

For $\sin(x)$, the coefficients $a_0, a_1, b_1$​ and $b_2$ are determined such that the Taylor series of $R_{1, 2}(x)$ matches the Taylor series of $\sin(x)$ up to the highest possible order. The first few terms of the Taylor series of $\sin(x)$ are:

$$\sin(x) = x - \frac{x^3}{3!} + \frac{x^5}{5!} - \frac{x^7}{7!} + \cdots$$

By equating the Taylor series of $R_{1, 2}(x)$ to that of $\sin(x)$ and solving for the coefficients, we find:

$$R_{1, 2}(x) = \frac{6x}{6 + x^2}$$

This approximation is particularly useful as it captures the oscillatory nature of the sine function while being a simple rational function.

### Why [1 2] Padé Approximation?

The choice of [1 2] for $\sin(x)$ is driven by the balance between simplicity and accuracy. Higher-order approximants could provide more accuracy but at the cost of increased complexity. The [1 2] approximant is a good starting point to demonstrate the method, especially for educational purposes.

### Visualizing the Approximation

In the next section, we will implement this approximation in MATLAB and visualize how closely the Padé approximant $R_{1,2}(x)$ follows the actual sine function over an interval. This visualization will help in understanding how well the Padé approximant can mimic the behavior of the original function and in what scenarios it may be particularly beneficial to use this method of approximation.

## 3. Implementation in MATLAB with Visualisations (Sine Function)

- MATLAB code for the sine function example.
- Explanation of each code segment.
- Discussion of the generated visualisations.

The implementation of Padé approximation in MATLAB for the sine function provides a clear visualization of how the approximation behaves in comparison to the actual function. We will use the [1 2] Padé approximation for this purpose.

### MATLAB Code for [1 2] Padé Approximation of Sine Function

Here's the MATLAB code snippet to compute and visualize the [1 2] Padé approximation of $\sin(x)$:

```matlab
% Define the symbolic variable and function
syms x
f(x) = sin(x);

% Define the Padé approximant of order [1 2]
R_12 = pade(f, x, Order = [1 2]);

% Define the interval for visualization
xint = [-3, 3];

% Plot the original function and its Padé approximation
figure;
fplot(f, xint, 'LineWidth', 1.5, 'Color', 'blue');
hold on;
fplot(R_12, xint, 'LineWidth', 1.5, 'Color', 'red');
hold off;

% Add labels, title, and legend
xlabel('x', 'Interpreter', 'latex', 'FontSize', 16);
ylabel('f(x)', 'Interpreter', 'latex', 'FontSize', 16);
title('Padé Approximation for $\sin(x)$', 'Interpreter', 'latex', 'FontSize', 16);
legend({'$\sin(x)$', '$R_{1,2}(x)$'}, 'Interpreter', 'latex', 'FontSize', 14, 'Location', 'northeast');
```

## 4. Function with a Singularity: Implementation and Visualisation

- Introduction to the function with a singularity (\( \ln(x) \)).
- MATLAB code for the logarithm example.
- Analysis of visualisations demonstrating the approximation near the singularity.

In this section, we focus on a function with a singularity, specifically ln⁡(x) \\ln(x) ln(x), and demonstrate how the Padé approximation can be effectively used to approximate it. We will expand ln⁡(x) \\ln(x) ln(x) at the point x\=1 x = 1 x\=1 using a \[2 2\] Padé approximant.

### Mathematical Formulation for $\ln(x)$ Padé Approximant

For the function $f(x) = \ln(x)$, the \[2 2\] Padé approximant expanded at $x = 1$ is given by:

$$R_{2,2}(x) = \frac{\frac{1}{2} (x - 1)^2 + (x - 1)}{\frac{1}{6} (x - 1)^2 + x}$$

This approximation is chosen because it provides a balance between accuracy and computational simplicity while effectively dealing with the singularity at $x = 0$.

### MATLAB Implementation

Now, let's implement this in MATLAB and visualize the approximation:

```matlab
% Define the symbolic variable and function
syms x
f(x) = log(x);

% Define the Padé approximant of order [2 2]
% numerator = 1/2 * (x - 1)^2 + (x - 1);
% denominator = 1/6 * (x - 1)^2 + x;
% R22(x) = numerator / denominator;
R22(x) = pade(f, x, Order = [2 2]);

% Define the interval for visualization
xint = [0.1, 2];

% Plot the original function and its Padé approximation
figure;
fplot(f, xint, 'LineWidth', 1.5, 'Color', 'blue');
hold on;
fplot(R22, xint, 'LineWidth', 1.5, 'Color', 'red');
hold off;

% Add labels, title, and legend
xlabel('x', 'Interpreter', 'latex', 'FontSize', 16);
ylabel('f(x)', 'Interpreter', 'latex', 'FontSize', 16);
title('Padé Approximation for $\ln(x)$', 'Interpreter', 'latex', 'FontSize', 16);
legend({'$\ln(x)$', '$R_{2,2}(x)$'}, 'Interpreter', 'latex', 'FontSize', 14, 'Location', 'southeast');
```

### Visualizing the \[2 2\] Padé Approximation for $\ln(x)$

Executing this code will produce a plot with the natural logarithm function and its \[2 2\] Padé approximant. The chosen interval \[0.1, 2\] allows for observation of the approximation behavior near the singularity at $x = 0$ and in a range where the logarithmic function exhibits significant curvature.

### Insights from the Visualization

The plot will show how the Padé approximant closely follows the logarithm function within the interval, especially near $x = 1$ where the expansion is centered. This example highlights the effectiveness of Padé approximations in handling functions with singularities. It also provides a visual insight into how the choice of expansion point and the order of the approximation can influence the accuracy and the range of effectiveness of the Padé approximant.
