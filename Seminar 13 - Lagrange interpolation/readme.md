# Lagrange interpolation error

## üìö Background

Polynomial interpolation, particularly through the method of Lagrange, is a critical technique for approximating complex functions that are computationally intensive to evaluate. When working with such functions, it's crucial to minimize the number of function evaluations, making the selection of interpolation nodes a task of paramount importance. Choosing the right nodes can lead to a more accurate and stable approximation, while poor selection can result in significant errors. The phenomenon of error amplification, notably in equidistant nodes, is highlighted by Runge's phenomenon, which is a stark example of the pitfalls of arbitrary node selection. The Lebesgue constant serves as a measure of the potential worst-case error, and the use of Chebyshev nodes is one strategy to mitigate the instability inherent in polynomial interpolation.

## üéØ Objectives

1. **Understanding Interpolation Stability**: Delve into the stability of Lagrange interpolation and learn the significance of node selection on the resulting error.
2. **Practical MATLAB Application**: Gain hands-on experience with MATLAB by using a given interpolation function and understanding numerical outputs.
3. **Graphical Analysis**: Employ MATLAB to graphically demonstrate the Lebesgue constant for various grids, thereby visualizing interpolation errors.
4. **Critical Analysis**: Critically evaluate the outcomes to discern the effects of different node distributions on interpolation error, and synthesize observations about node choices.
